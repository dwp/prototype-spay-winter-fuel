        You need to have a genuine and sufficient link to the UK though - this can include having lived and worked in the UK.

      <div class="govuk-inset-text">
        You cannot get the payment if you live in Cyprus, France, Gibraltar, Greece, Malta, Portugal or Spain because the average winter temperature there is higher than the warmest region in the UK.
